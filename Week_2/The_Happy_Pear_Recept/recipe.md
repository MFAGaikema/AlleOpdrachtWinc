* Using another similar sized pan put the slightly smaller pan over the mushrooms and compress the sliced mushrooms in the pan for 2-3 mins until they start to brown. Turn over and repeat until they have browned on both sides.

* Remove from the pan and add to the marinade and mix well.

* Reduce the heat of the pan to medium and add the marinade mushrooms back to the pan and cook for approx 1 min on each side, remove and set aside.

* Once cool slice into thin stips approx 1.5cm x 1.5cm 

* To bring together, heat a clean non stick pan on high heat. Add the pan a little of the sauce and the cooked pasta, add the rest of the sauce and bring to the boil.

* Once hot, taste and season and if it starts to become too thick add some pasta water to reach the desired texture and allow to reduce. Garnish with lots of "facon" and enjoy!
